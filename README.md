# Breast Cancer Regression Analysis

## **Objective:**
The objective of this project is to use R to train and compare the performance of two regression models for the prediction of breast cancer tumour characteristics. The tumour characteristic predictors include mean radius, mean perimeter, mean area, mean smoothness, and more.

Using 5-fold cross-validation, the following linear regression models were trained and compared:
* Ridge regression model
* Lasso model

## **Tools:**
1.	R - glmnet
