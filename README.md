# Breast Cancer Regression Analysis

## **Objective:**
The objective of this project is to use R to train and compare the performance of two regression models for the prediction of breast cancer tumour characteristics. Using 5-fold cross-validation, the following models were trained and compared:
* Ridge regression model
* Lasso model

## **Tools:**
1.	R - glmnet
